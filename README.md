# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For week#7 project we need to modify a code to create a smart thermostat. This is a low-level thermostat prototype.

What did you do particularly well?
For me I really understood how State Machines worked and how to implemented.

Where could you improve?
I can improve in every aspect of the project. This is completely new to me and I know it will take time to really grasp everything
I need to know and understand.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Embedded System is complicated and needs a lot of job to create our project. There is a lot to understand and to learn. For me, 
State Machines is the newest thing I learned, and the infinite loop. The whole class can add a lot of knowledge to my network and
to my overall skills.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think the knowledge and skill is been extended from previews classes. Using C and RIMS through the module added to my skills,
plus I learned more about Java with the Code Composer based in Eclipse.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using coding best practice in commenting my code, the formatting of the code and the functional logic. The way I write my code to be
able to reuse it, maintain and go back and understand what I did throung my comments. using the adequate formating like spacing can make
the code look more organize and readable.
